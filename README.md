# Critical Mass Granada

**"Masa Crítica Granada"** is a project aimed at reclaiming bicycle-friendly spaces in the city of Granada. We meet monthly to ride our bicycles accompanied by a ciclo-soundsystem, creating a vibrant and engaging atmosphere to raise awareness about the need for improved cycling infrastructure in our city. Through peaceful and collective demonstrations, the project seeks to promote sustainable transportation options and advocate for safer and more accessible roads for cyclists in Granada.
