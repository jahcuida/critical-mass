# Critical Mass Granada

**"Masa Crítica Granada"** 🚴‍♀️🌍 is a community-driven project aimed at reclaiming bicycle-friendly spaces in the city of Granada. We meet monthly to ride our bicycles accompanied by a **ciclo-soundsystem** 🔊, creating a vibrant and engaging atmosphere to raise awareness about the need for improved cycling infrastructure 🚲 in our city. Through peaceful and collective demonstrations ✊, the project promotes sustainable transportation and advocates for safer and more accessible roads for cyclists in Granada.
